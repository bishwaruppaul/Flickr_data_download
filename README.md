### Search Flickr using keywords and download details of the photos
<br>

This work was inspired by the repository [Flickr-API](https://github.com/FrancescaMancini/Flickr-API) by Francesa Mancini.

The R code file lets you search Flickr using any keyword, and download details of the photos obtained in the search result.

You can obtain the date when the photo was taken, location, latitude, longitude and a link for the file, which are saved in a CSV file. The name of the CSV file is set to be the same as the keyword you use to search.

Requires a Flickr API key, which you can obtain from [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
